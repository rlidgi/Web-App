# 🎯 Facebook Ad Conversion Tracking - Complete Setup Guide

## ✅ What You Now Have

Your Resumatic website now has a **complete Facebook ad tracking system** that tracks:

1. **📊 Visits from Facebook ads** - Every person who clicks your ad
2. **💰 Conversions (Resume Submissions)** - People who actually use your service
3. **📈 Campaign Performance** - ROI data for each ad campaign
4. **🔍 Detailed Analytics** - Conversion rates, traffic sources, and daily stats

## 🚀 How to Use Your New Tracking System

### Step 1: Create Facebook Ad URLs
Use these test URLs (replace with your domain when live):

```
http://localhost:5000/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=resume_boost_video&utm_content=video_ad

http://localhost:5000/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=job_hunt_carousel&utm_content=carousel_ad

http://localhost:5000/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=ai_resume_2024&utm_content=single_image
```

### Step 2: Set Up Your Facebook Ads
1. **Copy one of the URLs above**
2. **Paste it as the "Website URL" in your Facebook ad**
3. **Change the campaign name** to match your actual campaign
4. **Launch your ad!**

### Step 3: Monitor Performance
Visit: `http://localhost:5000/analytics` (or your live domain + /analytics)

You'll see:
- **Total visits** from Facebook ads
- **Conversion rate** (how many visitors submit resumes)
- **Campaign performance** for each ad
- **ROI data** to optimize your ad spend

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If tracking isn't working:
